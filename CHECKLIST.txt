Project Progress Checklist
=========================

BACKEND (Python FastAPI)
------------------------
- FastAPI server setup with CORS enabled
- CSV-based data storage for user entries and shaft measurements
- User entry endpoints (/user_entry):
  - Add user entry (POST)
  - Get all user entries (GET)
  - Update user entry (PUT)
  - Delete all user entries (DELETE)
  - Handles duplicate roll numbers with “welcome back” logic and updates last_login
  - Returns clear status messages and data
- Shaft measurement endpoints (/shaft_measurement):
  - Add shaft measurement (POST)
  - Get all shaft measurements (GET)
  - Update shaft measurement (PUT)
  - Delete all shaft measurements (DELETE)
- CSV initialization with correct headers for both user and shaft data
- Video streaming endpoints for instructional videos
- Error handling for missing fields, duplicates, and file issues

FRONTEND (Flutter)
------------------
- Global Material 3 theme with modern color scheme and Google Fonts
- User entry form with validation and “welcome back” toast
- Measurement workflow:
  - Category selection (shaft/housing)
  - Step-by-step measurement page with:
    - Step progress indicator
    - Instructional video for each step
    - Info dialog with context-specific instructions
    - Modern, accessible UI (cards, buttons, spacing)
    - Animated transitions between steps
    - Review and submit summary
- No sidebar on initial screen
- Consistent AppBar and navigation
- Snackbar/toast feedback for user actions
- Form always sends all required fields to backend
- Error handling for backend responses

ASSETS & DATA
-------------
- Instructional videos for each measurement step (height, radius, depth) for both shaft and housing
- CSV files for user entries and shaft measurements in backend/logs

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
------------------
- Linter errors resolved (Flutter and Python)
- UI/UX improvements (padding, spacing, card elevation, rounded corners)
- Backend and frontend integration tested via Postman

WHAT’S NEXT?
------------
- [ ] Add more measurement types or components (if needed)
- [ ] Add user authentication (if required)
- [ ] Add export/reporting features (CSV, PDF, etc.)
- [ ] Add more detailed instructional content (images, diagrams)
- [ ] Polish for production (app icon, splash screen, error pages)
